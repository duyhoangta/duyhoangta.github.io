<h3>Clone a respository</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Get the clone link:
        <img src="https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/clone-link.png" class="center" width="300" height="50">
    The link would look something like this: https://github.com/hunglvosu/subsetTSP.git</li>
    <li>Creat a local folder, point to it and type <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">git clone https://github.com/hunglvosu/subsetTSP.git</font>. A folder name "subsetTSP" will be created like in the following figure:
    <img src="https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/clone-command.png" class="center" width="300" height="50">
    </li>
    <li>Now you are ready to make changes, add files or do whatever you want to the folder. This is just local change, and nobody can see your change except you, unless you "commit" the change following the instructions below.</li>
</ol>

After cloning and make changes, you need to commit changes to the respository so other people can see it.

<h3>Commit changes</h3>
