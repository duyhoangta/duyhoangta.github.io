I am interested in Theoretical Computer Science in general and Graph Algorithms in particular. Before coming to Umass, I was:
- a PIMS postdoc at University of Victoria with Valerie King. 
- a PhD student at Oregon State University with Cora Borradaile.
- an undergraduate student at Hanoi University of Science and Technology.
