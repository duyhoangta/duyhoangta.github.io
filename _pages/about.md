I am a Research Fellow in the Information Theory group of [Prof. Yeow Meng Chee](https://nus.edu.sg/about/management/chee-yeow-meng) in National University of Singapore. Before coming to NUS, I earned my PhD at [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Omar Fawzi](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/omar.fawzi/). Long time ago, I got a B.S. degree in Computer Science (honors program) from <a href="http://en.hust.edu.vn/home">Hanoi University of Science and Technology</a>.
