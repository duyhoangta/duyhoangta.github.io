**Objectives**: This course provides students with skills in designing efficient algorithms. After completing this course, students are expected to be able to formulate an algorithmic problem,  design an algorithm for the problem, prove  the correctness, and analyze the running time. This course will illustrate these skills through various algorithmic problems and important design techniques. 

**Prerequisites**: Students are expected to have mathematical maturity and knowledge of COMPSCI 311 or equivalence. 

**Location**: Agricultural Engineering Building, Room 119.

**Academic Honesty and Collaboration Policy:**

- You must do exams and quizzes on your own. No collaboration is allowed.
- You might collaborate with **at most 2 other students** on homework. You must specify anyone you collaborated with in your submissions.  The collaboration is **verbal** only. The write-up must be your own. You are NOT allowed to talk about the homework with anyone else outside your group (except TAs and the instructor). You are NOT allowed to consult any material on the Internet to do your homework. 
- You are allowed to bring at most 2 pages of A4 cheatsheets to the exams. NO other materials are allowed. 
- DO ask if you have any questions regarding academic honesty.

As members of the College of Information and Computer Sciences at UMass Amherst, we expect everyone to behave responsibly and honorably. In particular, we expect each of you not to give, receive, or use aid in examinations, nor to give, receive, or use unpermitted aid in any academic work. Doing your part in observing this code, and ensuring that others do likewise is essential for having a community of respect, integrity, fairness, and trust.
If you cheat in a course, you are taking away from your own opportunity to learn and develop as a professional. You also hurt your colleagues, and this will hurt people you will work with in the future, who expect an honest and responsible professional.

As faculty, we pledge to use academic policies designed for fairness, avoiding situations that are conducive to violating academic honesty, as well as unreasonable or unusual procedures that assume dishonesty. We will follow the university's [Academic Honesty Policy and Procedures](https://www.umass.edu/honesty/). This means we will report instances of dishonesty, which may lead to formal sanction and/or failing the course.

**Late Policy:** You have **one late day** on any HW of your choice. Late submissions otherwise will not be graded unless you have a good medical reason. Try your best to honor the deadlines. 

**Posting Policy:**  You are not allowed to post any material in this course to public websites  without the permission of the instructor.

**Platforms:** We will use Moodle for general logistics, Campuswire for discussion and Gradescopes for homework assignments.

**Equity and Inclusion Statement**: We are committed to fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion, where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. This course is for everyone. This course is for you, regardless of your age, background, citizenship, disability, sex, education, ethnicity, family status, gender, gender identity, geographical origin, language, military experience, political views, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, or work experience. Because of that, we should realize that we will be bringing different skills to the course, and we will all be learning from and with each other. We may have different backgrounds and skills in courses taken, mathematical, algorithmic, coding or testing background, ways to communicate orally and in writing, working alone or in groups, or plans for professional careers.

Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude. Respect that people have differences of opinion, and work and approach problems differently. There is seldom a single right answer to complicated questions. Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum; any criticism should be constructive.

Disruptive behavior is not welcome, and insulting, demeaning, or harassing anyone is unacceptable. In particular, we don’t tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups. If you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by someone in this class, please contact a member of the course staff immediately, or if you feel uncomfortable doing so, contact the Dean of Students office.

This course is for all of us. We will all learn from each other. Welcome!

**Accommodations for Disabilities**: The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to making reasonable, effective and appropriate accommodations to meet the needs of students with disabilities and help create a barrier-free campus. If you have a disability and require accommodations, please register with Disability Services, located in 161 Whitmore Hall, (413) 545-0892, to have an accommodation letter sent to your faculty. Information on services and materials for registering is available on the [University of Massachusetts Amherst Disability Services](https://www.umass.edu/disability/) page.
