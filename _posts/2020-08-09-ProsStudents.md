Thank you for being interested in working with me. I enjoy working with students. And yes,  **I am looking for PhD students** starting from Fall 2023 (application due by December 15, 2022). Feel free to send your CV and your transcript to hungle@cs.umass.edu. Check out [here](https://www.cics.umass.edu/admissions/application-instructions) for general requirement; GRE is NOT required for PhD admission. Having a good math background will be appreciated. Note that I cannot answer questions regarding your chance of being admitted.
