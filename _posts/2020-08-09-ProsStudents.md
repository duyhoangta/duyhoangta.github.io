Hi,

Thanks for being interested in my research. I encourage you to apply to UMass, and mention my name in your application. I will look more closely into your profile.

Check out [here](https://www.cics.umass.edu/admissions/application-instructions) for general requirement; GRE is NOT required for PhD admission. Having a good math background will be appreciated. Note that I cannot answer questions regarding your chance of being admitted.
