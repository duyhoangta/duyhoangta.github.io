Thank you for being interested in working with me. I enjoy working with students. And yes,  **I am looking for PhD students** starting from Fall 20201 (application due by December 15, 2020). If you are interested, please be in touch with me **after** you complete your application.  Please check out [here](https://www.cics.umass.edu/admissions/application-instructions) for general requirement; GRE is NOT required for PhD admission. Having a good math background will be appreciated. Note that I cannot answer questions regarding your chance of being admitted, so please do not ask.
