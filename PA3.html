<br>
<b>Goal:</b> In this assignment, we will compute PageRank score for the web dataset provided by Google in a programming challenge in a programming constest in 2002.
<br>
<br>
<b>Input Format:</b> The datasets are given in txt. The file format is:
<ul> <li>Rows from 1 to 4: Metadata. They give information about the dataset and are self-explained.</li>
    <li>Following rows: each row consists of 2 values represents the link from the web page in the 1st column to the web page in the 2nd column. For example, if the row is  <font face="Courier" size="3" color="blue">0  &#9; 11342</font>, this means there is a directed link from the page id 0 to the page id 11324.</li>
</ul>
There are two dataset that we will work with in this assignment.
<ol> <li><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google_10k.txt</font>: This dataset contains 10,000 web pages and 78323 links. The dataset can be downloaded from <a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/web-Google_10k.zip">here</a>.
</li>
     <li><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google.txt</font>: This dataset contains 875,713 web pages and 5,105,039 links. The dataset can be downloaded from <a href = "https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Google.txt.gz">here</a></li>
    </ol>
<br>
<br>
<b>Output Format:</b> output must be given in tsv format, with two columns:
<ul> <li>The first column is the PageRank score.</li>
    <li>The second column is the corresponding web page id.</li>
</ul>
<font color = "red">The output must be sorted by descending order of the PageRank scores.</font>
<a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/toy_output.tsv">Here</a> is a sample output for this <a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/toy_graph.txt">toy dataset</a>.

<br>
<br>
There are two questions in this assigment worth 50 points total. The taxation parameter in both question is &#946; = 0.85.
<br>
<br>
<b>Question 1 (20 points): </b> Implement the PageRank algorithm for dataset <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google_10k.txt</font>. For full score, your algorithm must run in <b>less than 30 seconds</b>.
<br>
<br>
<b>Question 2 (30 points):</b> Implement the PageRank algorithm for dataset <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google.txt</font>. For full score, your algorithm must run in <b>less than 2 minutes</b>.
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<b>Note 1:</b> Submit your code and output data to the Connex
<br>

<h1 align="center">FAQ</h1>
<br>
<b>Q1:</b> How do I deal with dead ends?
<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I deal with deadend by recursively removing dead ends from the graph until there is no dead end. Then, I calculate the PageRank for the remaining nodes. Upon having the PageRank scores, I update the score for dead ends, by the  <font color = "red">reverse</font> removing oder. Here I stress that the update order is reverse.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q2:</b> Do I initiate the PageRank score?
<br>
<b>Answer:</b> You should initiate the PageRank score for each page to be the same. Remember that we only run the actual PageRank after removing dead ends. Let's say the number of pages after removing dead ends is <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">Np</font>, then each node should be initialized a PageRank score of <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">1.0/Np.</font> It does not matter how do you initialze PageRanke score for dead ends because they are not involved in the actual PageRank calculation.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q3:</b> How do I know that my calculation is correct?
<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Run your algorithm on the sample input, make sure that the order of the pages by the PageRank scores matches with that of the sample output. There may be a slight difference in the PageRanke scores itself (because of rounding off errorr), but the oder of the pages should be unaffected. Note that dead ends in the sample input are pages with ids <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">4</font> and <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">5</font>.

Also, check with the following outputs, that I take 10 pages with highest PageRank scores for each dataset:
<ol> <li><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google_10k.txt</font>: here is a <a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/sample_output_10k.tsv">sample output</a>. This data has <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">1544</font> dead ends total.</li>
            <li><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google.txt</font>: here is a <a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/sample_output_80k.tsv">sample output</a>. This data has <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">181057</font> dead ends total.</li></li>
        </ol>
