<h2>Please note that <a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/HW3.pdf">written homework 3 is up</a>.</h2>
<br>
<br>
<b>Goal:</b> In this assignment, we will compute PageRank score for the web dataset provided by Google in a programming challenge in a programming constest in 2002.
<br>
<br>
<b>Input Format:</b> The datasets are given in txt. The file format is:
<ul> <li>Rows from 1 to 4: Metadata. They give information about the dataset and are self-explained.</li>
    <li>Following rows: each row consists of 2 values represents the link from the web page in the 1st column to the web page in the 2nd column. For example, if the row is  <font face="Courier" size="3" color="blue">0  &#9; 11342</font>, this means there is a directed link from the page id 0 to the page id 11324.</li>
</ul>
There are two dataset that we will work with in this assignment.
<ol> <li><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google_10k.txt</font>: This dataset contains 10,000 web pages and 78323 links. The dataset can be downloaded from <a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/web-Google_10k.zip">here</a>. DO NOT assume that page ids are from 0 to 10,000.
</li>
     <li><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google.txt</font>: This dataset contains 875,713 web pages and 5,105,039 links. The dataset can be downloaded from <a href = "https://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Google.txt.gz">here</a>. DO NOT assume that page ids are from 0 to 875,713.</li>
    </ol>
Also, it's helpful to test your algorithm with this <a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/toy_graph.txt">toy dataset</a>.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Output Format:</b> the output format for each quesion will be specified below.
<br>
<br>
<br>
There are two questions in this assigment worth 50 points total.
<br>
<br>
<b>Question 1 (20 points): </b> Find all dead ends. A node is a dead end if it has no out-going edges or all its outoging edges points to dead ends. For example, consider the graph A->B->C->D. All nodes A,B,C,D are dead ends by this definition. D is a dead end because it has no outgoing edge. C is a dead end because its only out-going neighbor, D, is a dead end. B is a dead end for the same reason, so is A.
     <ol><li>(10 points) Find all dead ends of the dataset <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google_10k.txt</font>.  For full score, your algorithm must run in <b>less than 15 seconds</b>. The output must be written to a file named <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">deadends_10k.tsv</font></li>
         <li>(10 points) Find all dead ends of the dataset <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google_800k.txt</font>.  For full score, your algorithm must run in <b>less than 1 minute</b>. The output must be written to a file named <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">deadends_800k.tsv</font></li>
    </ol>
The output format for Question 1 is single column, where each column is the id of an dead end. See  <a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/deadends_toy.tsv">here</a> for a sample output for the toy dataset.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Question 2 (30 points):</b> Implement the PageRank algorithm for both datasets. The taxation parameter for both dataset is &#946; = 0.85 and the number of PageRank iterations is T = 10.
    <ol> <li>(15 points)Run your algorithm for <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google_10k.txt</font> dataset. For full score, your algorithm must run in <b>less than 30 seconds</b>. The output must be written to a file named <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">PR_10k.tsv</font></li>
         <li>(15 points)Run your algorithm for <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google.txt</font> dataset. For full score, your algorithm must run in <b>less than 2 minutes</b>. The output must be written to a file named <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">PR_800k.tsv</font></li>
    </ol>
The output format for Question 2 is two-column:
<ul> <li>The first column is the PageRank score.</li>
    <li>The second column is the corresponding web page id.</li>
</ul>
<font color = "red">The output must be sorted by descending order of the PageRank scores.</font>
<a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/toy_output.tsv">Here</a> is a sample output for the toy dataset above.
</ol>

<br>
<h1 align="center">FAQ</h1>
<br>
<b>Q1:</b> How do I deal with dead ends?
<br>
<b>Answer:</b> I deal with deadend by recursively removing dead ends from the graph until there is no dead end. Then, I calculate the PageRank for the remaining nodes. Upon having the PageRank scores, I update the score for dead ends, by the  <font color = "red">reverse</font> removing oder. Here I stress that the update order is reverse.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q2:</b> Do I initiate the PageRank score?
<br>
<b>Answer:</b> You should initiate the PageRank score for each page to be the same. Remember that we only run the actual PageRank after removing dead ends. Let's say the number of pages after removing dead ends is <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">Np</font>, then each node should be initialized a PageRank score of <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">1.0/Np.</font> It does not matter how do you initialze PageRanke score for dead ends because they are not involved in the actual PageRank calculation.
<br>
<br>
<b>Q3:</b> How do I know that my calculation is correct?
<br>
<b>Answer:</b> Run your algorithm on the sample input, make sure that the order of the pages by the PageRank scores matches with that of the sample output. There may be a slight difference in the PageRanke scores itself (because of round-off error), but the oder of the pages should be unaffected. 

Also, check with the following outputs, that I take 10 pages with highest PageRank scores for each dataset:
<ol> <li><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google_10k.txt</font>: here is a <a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/sample_output_10k.tsv">sample output</a>. This data has <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">1544</font> dead ends total.</li>
            <li><font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">web-Google.txt</font>: here is a <a href = "https://hunglvosu.github.io/res/sample_output_800k.tsv">sample output</a>. This data has <font face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" size="3" color="blue">181057</font> dead ends total.</li></li>
        </ol>
<br>
<b>Q4:</b> What do I do if I get the out of memory error on 800K dataset?
<br>
<b>Answer:</b> It's probably because you construct a transition matrix to do PageRank computation. This matrix takes about 5TB (not GB) of memory, so it's is natural that you will run out of memory. The way to get around is using two adjacency list, say L, together with the algorithm in page 21 of my note. For node i, L[i] is the set of nodes that link to i. Also, you should use a degree array D, where D[i] is the out-degree of i. That is, D[i] the number of links from i to other nodes.
