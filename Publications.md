  Understanding the structure of minor-free metrics, namely shortest path metrics obtained
      over a weighted graph excluding a fixed minor, has been an important research direction
      since the fundamental work of Robertson and Seymour. A fundamental idea that helps both to understand the structural properties of these metrics     and lead to strong algorithmic results is to construct a ``small-complexity''      graph that approximately preserves distances between pairs of points of the metric. We show the two following structural results for minor-free metrics:<br>
      <ul><li>Construction of a <i>light</i> subset spanner. Given a  subset of vertices called terminals, and $\epsilon$,  in polynomial time we construct a subgraph that
      preserves all pairwise distances between terminals up to a multiplicative $1+\epsilon$ factor, of total weight at most $O_{\epsilon}(1)$ times the weight of the minimal Steiner tree spanning the terminals.</li>
      <li>Construction of a stochastic metric embedding into low treewidth graphs with expected additive distortion $\epsilon D$. Namely, given a minor free graph $G=(V,E,w)$ of diameter $D$, and parameter $\epsilon$, we construct a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over dominating metric embeddings into  treewidth-$O_{\epsilon}(\log n)$ graphs such that $\forall u,v\in V$, $\mathbb{E}_{f\sim\mathcal{D}}[d_H(f(u),f(v))]\le d_G(u,v)+\epsilon D$.</li>
      </ul>
    One of our important technical contributions is a novel framework that allows us to reduce <i>both problems</i> to problems on simpler graphs of <i>bounded diameter</i> that we solve using a new decomposition. Our results have the following algorithmic consequences: (1) the first efficient approximation scheme for subset TSP in minor-free metrics; (2) the first approximation scheme for vehicle routing with bounded capacity in minor-free metrics; (3) the first efficient approximation scheme for vehicle routing with bounded capacity on bounded genus metrics.
      En route to the latter result, we design the first FPT approximation scheme for vehicle routing with  bounded capacity on bounded treewidth graphs (parameterized by the treewidth).
